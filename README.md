## ✅ Grafana Dashboards & Alerts

---

### **1. Resource Utilization Metrics & Dashboards**
Create metrics and Grafana dashboards for monitoring infrastructure resource usage:

- **CPU Usage**
- **Memory Consumption**
- **Garbage Collection (GC) Metrics**
- **Job Health**
- **Job Execution History**
- **Kafka Health Metrics**
- **Cluster Usage & Health**

### **2. Job-Specific Metrics, Alerts & Dashboards**
Monitor and visualize metrics for batch or background jobs:

- **Job Throughput** – Number of jobs executed over time
- **Job Execution Duration** – Time taken per job
- **Job Failures** – Count and reason for failed jobs
- **Job Availability** – Job uptime and availability metrics

**→ Alerts:**
- Configure threshold-based alerts for throughput drops, failures, or SLA breaches.

### **3. API / Service Metrics & Dashboards**
Create real-time service observability dashboards:

- **TPS (Transactions Per Second)**
- **Latency (Response Time)**
- **Error Rate (4xx/5xx HTTP errors, timeouts, exceptions)**

**→ Use distributed tracing or APM tools for granular latency tracking.**

### **4. Alerting to Operations Team**
Set up alert routing and incident management:

- **P1 (Critical) Issues**
    - Immediately **page the Operations team**
    - **Create a ServiceNow (SNOW) incident**
- **P2, P3 (High/Medium Priority) Issues**
    - **Create a SNOW incident** automatically
    - Notify via Slack/Email for awareness
