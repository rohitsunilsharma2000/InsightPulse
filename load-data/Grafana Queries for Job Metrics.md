To set up **Grafana dashboards** for measuring **Job Specific Metrics**, such as **Job Throughput**, **Job Execution Duration**, **Job Failures**, and **Job Availability**, you'll need to follow a few steps. These steps include collecting the necessary metrics, setting up Prometheus to scrape them, and then creating appropriate dashboards and alerts in Grafana.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you set up **Grafana dashboards** for the mentioned metrics:

### **Step 1: Define the Job-Specific Metrics**
These are the core metrics you'll want to monitor for your job(s):

1. **Job Throughput**: Measures how many jobs or tasks are processed in a given period.
    - Metric: Count of jobs processed in a specific time window.

2. **Job Execution Duration**: Tracks how long each job takes to execute.
    - Metric: Duration of job executions.

3. **Job Failures**: Measures the number of jobs that fail.
    - Metric: Count of failed jobs.

4. **Job Availability**: Indicates if the job is running or has been unavailable.
    - Metric: Job status (running, failed, completed).

### **Step 2: Expose the Metrics in Your Application**

To monitor these job-specific metrics, you’ll need to expose the necessary metrics from your application (e.g., a job processing system, batch jobs, etc.) using **Micrometer** in Spring Boot or a custom metric collection approach.

Here’s an example of how you could expose these metrics using **Spring Boot** and **Micrometer**:

#### **1. Job Throughput**
Use a counter to track the number of jobs processed.

```java
import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Counted;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class JobService {

    @Counted(value = "job_throughput", description = "Number of jobs processed")
    public void processJob() {
        // job processing logic
    }
}
```

#### **2. Job Execution Duration**
Use a timer to track the duration of job executions.

```java
import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Timed;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class JobService {

    @Timed(value = "job_execution_duration", description = "Time taken to process a job")
    public void processJob() {
        // job processing logic
    }
}
```

#### **3. Job Failures**
Use a counter to track the number of failed jobs.

```java
import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Counted;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class JobService {

    @Counted(value = "job_failures", description = "Number of failed jobs")
    public void processFailedJob() {
        // job failure logic
    }
}
```

#### **4. Job Availability**
Track the availability of the job service (whether it's up or down).

```java
import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Gauge;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class JobService {

    private boolean jobServiceAvailable = true; // Change this value based on availability

    @Gauge(value = "job_availability", description = "Job availability status")
    public boolean jobAvailability() {
        return jobServiceAvailable;
    }
}
```

### **Step 3: Configure Prometheus to Scrape the Metrics**
In your **`prometheus.yml`** configuration, make sure to scrape the Spring Boot application or your custom job metric source:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'job-metrics'
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']  # Replace with your application's address
```

Start Prometheus with this configuration:

```bash
prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

### **Step 4: Set Up Grafana**
Now that you have the metrics exposed in Prometheus, let’s set up **Grafana** to visualize and alert on them.

1. **Install Grafana**: If you don’t have Grafana installed, use the following command (macOS example):

   ```bash
   brew install grafana
   ```

2. **Start Grafana**:

   ```bash
   brew services start grafana
   ```

   Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` (default username: `admin`, password: `admin`).

3. **Add Prometheus as a Data Source**:
    - In Grafana, go to **Configuration** > **Data Sources**.
    - Add **Prometheus** as a data source and set the URL to `http://localhost:9090` (where Prometheus is running).
    - Click **Save & Test**.

### **Step 5: Create Grafana Dashboards for Job Metrics**

#### **Job Throughput Panel**:
- **Query**: `sum(rate(job_throughput[1m]))`
- **Visualization**: **Stat** or **Graph** to show the total number of jobs processed in the last minute.

#### **Job Execution Duration Panel**:
- **Query**: `avg(job_execution_duration_seconds)`
- **Visualization**: **Graph** or **Stat** to show the average duration of job execution.

#### **Job Failures Panel**:
- **Query**: `sum(rate(job_failures[1m]))`
- **Visualization**: **Stat** or **Graph** to show the total number of failed jobs in the last minute.

#### **Job Availability Panel**:
- **Query**: `avg(job_availability)`
- **Visualization**: **Stat** or **Gauge** to show whether the job service is available (1 for up, 0 for down).

### **Step 6: Set Up Alerts in Grafana**
To alert you when certain thresholds are met (e.g., job failures exceed a certain number, or the job availability drops to zero), you can set up **alerts** in Grafana:

1. **Configure Alerting**:
    - In Grafana, open the **Panel Editor** for your panel (e.g., **Job Failures**).
    - Go to the **Alert** tab.
    - Set the alert condition. For example:
        - **WHEN**: `avg() of query (A, 1m, now)` **IS ABOVE** `5` (to trigger an alert if job failures exceed 5 in the last minute).
        - **Evaluate every**: `1 minute`.
        - **For**: `5 minutes` (wait 5 minutes before triggering the alert).

2. **Set Alert Notifications**:
    - After setting the condition, configure **Notification Channels** (e.g., email, Slack, etc.) to receive alerts.
    - To configure notification channels, go to **Alerting** > **Notification Channels** in Grafana and add a channel like Slack or email.

3. **Save the Dashboard**:
    - Click **Save Dashboard** to save your job-specific metrics dashboard.

### **Step 7: Visualizing and Monitoring Job Metrics**

Your **Grafana Dashboard** will now have the following panels:

1. **Job Throughput** (Total jobs processed).
2. **Job Execution Duration** (Average job execution time).
3. **Job Failures** (Total number of failed jobs).
4. **Job Availability** (Whether the job service is available).

You can also monitor these metrics in real time and get alerts when something goes wrong.

### **Example Grafana Queries for Job Metrics**

1. **Job Throughput**:
   ```prometheus
   sum(rate(job_throughput[1m]))
   ```

2. **Job Execution Duration**:
   ```prometheus
   avg(job_execution_duration_seconds)
   ```

3. **Job Failures**:
   ```prometheus
   sum(rate(job_failures[1m]))
   ```

4. **Job Availability**:
   ```prometheus
   avg(job_availability)
   ```

### **Conclusion**
You’ve now set up a **Grafana dashboard** to monitor **Job Throughput**, **Job Execution Duration**, **Job Failures**, and **Job Availability** using **Prometheus** metrics. Alerts are configured to notify you when job failures exceed a certain threshold or when job availability drops. Let me know if you need further assistance!
